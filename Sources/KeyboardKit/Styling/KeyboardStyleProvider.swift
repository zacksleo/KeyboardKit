/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can define
 styles for different parts of a keyboard.
 
 KeyboardKit will create a ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider``
 instance when the keyboard extension is started, then apply
 it to ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``. It's then used
 as the default provider, for instance in ``SystemKeyboard``.
 
 To change the style of some parts of your keyboard, you can
 implement a custom keyboard style provider.

 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 implement it from scratch or inherit the standard class and
 override the parts that you want to change. When the custom
 implementation is done, you can just replace the controller
 service to make KeyboardKit use the custom service globally.
