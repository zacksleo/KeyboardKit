# Essentials

This article describes the essential parts of KeyboardKit.

KeyboardKit extends Apple's limited keyboard APIs with many new features and views, makes the text document proxy more capable, and lets you use SwiftUI instead of UIKit.

KeyboardKit also has a ``SystemKeyboard`` view, that mimics the native iOS keyboard and can be customized and styled to great extent.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a lot of essential Pro features, like more locales, autocomplete, emoji utilities, dictation, etc. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Keyboard namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Keyboard`` namespace with basic, keyboard-related types, like ``Keyboard/Case``, ``Keyboard/AutocapitalizationType``, ``Keyboard/ReturnKeyType``, etc.

This namespace doesn't have protocols, open classes, or types that are meant to be top-level.



## Keyboard input view controller

``KeyboardInputViewController`` is the most essential type in the library. Just make your **KeyboardController** inherit this class to get access to a bunch of additional capabilities.

KeyboardKit also has a ``KeyboardController`` protocol that aims to make it easier to use KeyboardKit in platforms that don't support UIKit. This is however not fully implemented yet.



## Keyboard context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``KeyboardContext`` class that provides keyboard state, has a ``KeyboardContext/textDocumentProxy`` reference, and lets you get and set ``KeyboardContext/locale``, ``KeyboardContext/keyboardType``, etc.

You can use the context to affect the keyboard. For instance, setting the ``KeyboardContext/keyboardType`` will update the ``SystemKeyboard`` accordingly.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, and syncs it with the controller whenever needed.



## Keyboard behavior

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardBehavior`` protocol that can be used to define the keyboard's behavior. It's used by e.g. the ``StandardKeyboardActionHandler`` to make decisions.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can modify or replace it at any time.



## Views

### System Keyboard

KeyboardKit has a ``SystemKeyboard`` that mimics a native iOS keyboards and can be used to create alphabetic, numeric and symbolic keyboards.

``SystemKeyboard`` supports all ``KeyboardLocale``s, custom layouts, callouts, and can be customized and styled to great extent, using a ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` or Pro **Theme**s.

KeyboardKit will by default use a standard ``SystemKeyboard``. See <doc:Getting-Started> for more information on how you can configure this view, or replace it with any custom view.


### How to customize the system keyboard

``SystemKeyboard`` can be customized to great extent. You can pass in custom services and state, and replace any part of the keyboard:

* **buttonContent** can be used to customize the content view of any button.
* **buttonView** can be used to customize the entire view of any button.
* **emojiKeyboard** can be used to customize the **.emojis** keyboard view.
* **toolbar** can be used to customize the toolbar view above the keyboard.

To use the standard views, just return `{ $0.view }`, or `{ params in params.view }`:

```swift
SystemKeyboard(
    controller: controller,
    buttonContent: { $0.view },
    buttonView: { $0.view },
    emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
    toolbar: { params in params.view }
)
```

To customize or replace the standard content and item views for any layout item, just return any custom view in any view builder:

```swift
SystemKeyboard(
    controller: controller,
    buttonContent: { $0.view },
    buttonView: { $0.view },
    emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
    toolbar: { _ in Text("No toolbar here!") }
)
```

Some view builder parameters provide more information. For instance, the button view builders provide you with the full layout item, the toolbar provides you with autocomplete actions, etc.


### Toolbar

Since it's always a a good idea to have at least 50 points above the keyboard, KeyboardKit has a `Keyboard/Toolbar` view that applies a minimum height to its content.




## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional, powerful capabilities for the ``SystemKeyboard``.


### Locales

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks localized layouts, callouts, and services for all ``KeyboardLocale``s. This means that you can support up to 63 locales without having to write any additional code.

### Emoji Keyboard

KeyboardKit Pro (from Silver and up) will make ``SystemKeyboard`` use an **EmojiKeyboard** view (read more in <doc:Emojis-Article>) as the default emoji keyboard.

![EmojiKeyboard](emojikeyboard-350.jpg)

This means that by just registering a valid license key, your keyboard will automatically show an emoji keyboard when ``KeyboardContext/keyboardType`` changes to ``Keyboard/KeyboardType/emojis``.


### System Keyboard Preview

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a **SystemKeyboardPreview** that can preview different configurations and themes. It's a regular view that you can place anywhere:

```swift
struct MyView: View {

    var body: some View {
        SystemKeyboardPreview(theme: try? .candyShop)
    }
}
```

See the <doc:Previews-Article> article for more information.
