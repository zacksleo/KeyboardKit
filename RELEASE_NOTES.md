## 8.0

Welcome to KeyboardKit 8.0 - a massive update to the KeyboardKit SDK!


### 📣 Major Changes

KeyboardKit 8.0 is all about cleaning up the library to make it better structured and easier to use. It removes previously deprecated code, moves types into namespaces, and removes low-value utilities, including types solely used for DocC exposure.

Central types like `SystemKeyboard` are easier to use. Passing state and services instead of a controller reduces the risk for memory leaks. It also no longer needs a width, but will take up as much space as it needs.

These updates has helped enabling new features, like fading the keyboard buttons while moving the cursor with space and other quality of life improvements and fixes. Accessibility has been drastically improved and the emoji keyboard redesigned.

Most emoji features are now Pro features, including the emoji keyboard. The `SystemKeyboard` automatically removes the emoji key if no emoji keyboard is available.

The documentation has been extensively updated to provide more information and code examples. Please report any inconsistencies found, as many changes have been made.

I hope that you will love this major update to KeyboardKit!


### 🛟 KeyboardKit 8 Migration Help

If you're a KeyboardKit 7 user, the best way to migrate to KeyboardKit 8 is to first upgrade to the last available 7.9 version. This version contains deprecations that helps you prepare for some of the changes in KeyboardKit 8.

As you then upgrade to KeyboardKit 8, the 8.0 release has many TEMPORARY deprecations to assist migration from KeyboardKit 7. These temporary deprecations will be removed in 8.1.

You may run into some breaking changes, since there are some type changes that can't be handled by these deprecations. I have tried to keep these to a minimum, but see the breaking changes section below if you run into any problems.
