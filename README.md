## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit helps you create custom keyboard extensions with Swift and SwiftUI. 

KeyboardKit extends Apple's native APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you create custom keyboards that mimic native iOS keyboards with just a few lines of code.

</p>

KeyboardKit lets you customize all parts of the keyboard. You can use custom layouts, designs, behavior, etc. and make any key or gesture trigger any action. You can even use completely custom views and just use the underlying functionality.

You can use KeyboardKit in many different ways. Keyboard extensions can use it to create custom keyboards. Apps can use it to check keyboard enabled state, full access, state, provide settings etc. Furthermore, any target can use it to build upon its models and functionality.



## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git

After installing KeyboardKit, make sure to link it to all targets that need it.

## Getting Started

After installing KeyboardKit, just make your `KeyboardViewController` inherit ``KeyboardInputViewController`` instead of `UIInputViewController`:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This gives your controller access to new lifecycle functions like `viewWillSetupKeyboard`, observable state like `state.keyboardContext`, services like `services.actionHandler`, and much more.

KeyboardKit will use a `SystemKeyboard` as the default keyboard view. To customize or replace it, override `viewWillSetupKeyboard()` and call any `setup` function with any custom view:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
        setup { controller in
            SystemKeyboard(
                state: controller.state,
                services: controller.services,
                buttonContent: { $0.view },
                buttonView: { $0.view },
                emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
                toolbar: { _ in MyCustomToolbar() }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

For more information, please see the [getting started guide][Getting-Started].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has more information, articles, code examples, etc.



## Demo App

The repository has a demo app that shows how to display keyboard state, link to system settings, etc. 

The app has two keyboards: 

* `Keyboard` uses KeyboardKit and a customized `SystemKeyboard`.
* `KeyboardPro` uses KeyboardKit Pro and a customized `SystemKeyboard` with all locales, autocomplete, themes etc.

Just open and run the demo app in the `Demo` folder, then enable the keyboards under System Settings. Note that you need to enable full access for some features, like haptic feedback.



## KeyboardKit App

If you want to try KeyboardKit Pro without having to write any code or build the demo app from Xcode, there [KeyboardKit app][App] in the App Store lets you try out many pro features.
